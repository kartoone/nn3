# Code samples for "Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

This repository was manually adpated to Python3 by Brian Toone
from the code within the book on ["Neural Networks
and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) my Michael Nielsen.

The code was originally written for Python 2.6 or 2.7. 
Michal Daniel Dobrzanski has an alternative repository for Python 3
[here](https://github.com/MichalDanielDobrzanski/DeepLearningPython35).

The program `src/network3.py` uses version 0.6 or 0.7 of the Theano
library.  It needs modification for compatibility with later versions
of the library.  I will not be making such modifications.

As the code is written to accompany the book, I don't intend to add
new features. However, bug reports are welcome, and you should feel
free to fork and modify the code.
